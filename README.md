# Weather2 - Remastered
Originally by Corosauce (Or Corosus on Curse Forge). This mod is a decent update to the Weather2 mod found here: https://github.com/Corosauce/weather2.

For the time being, the updates will only be for existing minecraft versions like and not limited to 1.7.10 and 1.12.2. If I can learn how to replace things that are required from the mod CoroUtil (https://github.com/Corosauce/CoroUtil), then I will attempt to update above 1.12.2.

## Got Bugs Or Suggestions?
I will accept any bugs or suggestions that came from Weather2 since the code right now mainly is a clone of the original mod. Feel free to post your bugs, issues, exploits and suggestions under the **Issues Tab**. You can also post your questions and suggestions in the **Discussions Tab**. You can chat there too if you'd like.

## How Far Is The Update?
While I can't list everything that was aleady done, I am listing the things that I am currently working on or have in the **Projects Tab**. Check there for a list of things I am working on. May not contain everything for now.

## How To Build
The mod is currently not going to be released here until I get a stable alpha out. I gotta fix a lot of building issues. I may release the new api for this mod however, so be on the lookout for that if you want to add support to the update.


*Remember, I did not make Weather2 or CoroUtils. I am only updating this mod as a fan, and may or may not continue updating. Please give credit to Corosause for the amazing mod he gave us.*
